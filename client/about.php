            <p>Welcome to Harvey Lake Dragon Boats! Established in 2019, Harvey Lake Dragon Boat has several leagues for
                all ages and abilities, ranging in teen leagues to 65 plus, beginners to seasoned veterans. Practicing
                an over
                2500 year old Chinese tradition, we have teams that participate in races all over the country. Most
                recently
                our Community Division D team took Gold at the Riverfront Dragon Boat Races in Hartford, CT. </p>

            <p>Dragon Boat Races are a traditional Chinese watersport that began during the Warring States Period
                (402-221BC). In China it is normally held during the Tuen NG Festival which is around May or June on the
                Western Calendar. As the name implies, teams compete in a long narrow boat designed with a dragon head,
                tail and scales on the hull. The team paddles together to the direction of the drummer. The drummer
                beats
                a drum on the hull of the boat making sure the team stays in sync and provides motivation during the
                race.</p>

            <p>Check out our gallery for pictures of our recent races. Take a look at our teams and sign up for a truly
                incredibly experience. Dragon boat racing is great exercise, a good opportunity to meet great people and
                be
                a part of a wonderful adventure! Remember, what matters most is you stay out of the water and in the
                boat!</p>
